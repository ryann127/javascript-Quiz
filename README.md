## Functionality of Website and Points of Interest

When you click on the start button a timer starts and you are presented with a question, which then tells you if you wrong or correct and moves on to the next question. 

The timer will reflect if the answer was correct or incorrect. 

The game is over when the last question is reached and/or the timer has reached zero.
